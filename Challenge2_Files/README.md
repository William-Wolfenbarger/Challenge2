# Project Title

This project is designed to rapidly accelerate the loan qualification process for front-end users by allowing them to input the criteria necessary to be reviewed. As long as at least one qualifying loan is found from the bank data pool, users will have the option to save the qualifying loans to a CSV file so that they can share the results via a spreadsheet. This application will streamline loan qualification for users by eliminating the need to submit an individual loan application for each individual bank, and allow for direct comparison by smoothly exporting data into a spreadsheet.

## Technologies

This loan qualification app was built using Python. Essential to import sys, fire, question, and pathlib (Path). We also used a modular framework established in a qualifier folder which contained a utils folder that had helper functions to load csv data and financial calculators as well as a filters folder, used to hold 4 filters that elminated loans the user did not qualify for in the final list based off of entered criteria.
